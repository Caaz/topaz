# Topaz
With any luck, a javascript framework in which games can be easily thrown onto.
Laziness is my top priority. I plan on making things work as easily as possible.

This is fairly early in the life of this project, but I doubt it'll become anything interesting so feel free to skip on by.

## Using Topaz


### To-do
- Write how to use Topaz.
- Put up some examples
- Get rid of the need for JQuery **possibly**
- Figure out the viewport and make it better.
- Do something about proper unit sizing
- Don't link fps to game logic. Do something about that.
